Ideas:
  - TUI with vim bindings, wave form and overview of tracks/playlists/crates 
  - export: export data in rekordbox format, since all major players support
    this format
  - try to make playlists generic, such that smart algorithms/AI can generate
    playlists/analyze tracks somehow
  - save track information/playlists etc in some intermediate open format, which
    can be stored in git and is human readable and can be exported as rekordbox
    database
